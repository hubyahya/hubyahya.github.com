Pre-requisites
------

This tutorial requires that you followed the [basic tutorial](/docs/getting-started/basic-tutorial) and added the following components to your ODH deployment using the KfDef shown below:

* spark-operator
* hue
* thrift-server
* ceph-nano


```yaml
# ODH uses the KfDef manifest format to specify what components will be included in the deployment

Exploring Data Catalog
------

The Data Catalog is a set of components with which you can 
read data stored in Data Lakes, create tables and query them in a SQL-like style. You can find
below a picture of the simplified architecture of Data Catalog:

![Data Catalog Architecture](../../assets/img/pages/docs/data-catalog/architecture.png "Data Catalog Architecture")

These are the components that are part of Data Catalog:

* Spark SQL Thrift server to enable an endpoint where clients can connect using an ODBC/JDBC connection
* Cloudera Hue as a Data Exploration tool to explore the Data Lake, create tables and query them. You can 
also create dashboards using the tables managed by Hive Metastore

Using Data Catalog
------

1. Find the route to Hue. Within your Open Data Hub Project click on Networking -> Routes
![OpenShift routes](../assets/img/pages/docs/data-catalog/routes.png "OpenShift routes")

1. For the route named hue, click on the location to bring up Hue (typically `http://hue-project.apps.your-cluster.your-domain.com`).

2. It will open the first-time login page where you can create the superuser for Hue.
![Hue user creation](../../assets/img/pages/docs/data-catalog/hue-user-creation.png "Hue user creation")

1. As the first login, Hue will show a tutorial about the interface. You can skip the tutorial by closing the window.
![Hue tutorial](../../assets/img/pages/docs/data-catalog/tutorial.png "Hue tutorial")

1. The Hue editor will appear in a blank textarea.
![Hue editor](../../assets/img/pages/docs/data-catalog/editor.png "Hue editor")

Now we can create a table from a file inside the Data Lake.

Creating and querying tables
------

1. Let's create first a database with the following command (You can run the query by either clicking on the play button in the left or type Ctrl+Enter):
```
CREATE DATABASE opendatahub;
```

1. In the explorer, click on the refresh button. The new database will appear:
![New database created](../../assets/img/pages/docs/data-catalog/new-database.png "New database created"){:class="img-auto"}

1. Now let's select the database with the command:
```
USE opendatahub;
```

1. We will create a table from the `sample_data.csv` file used in the `Basic Tutorial` section:
```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE opendatahub.sample(
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    name STRING,
    field STRING,
    primary_audience STRING,
    key_people STRING,
    outcome STRING,
    full_notes STRING,
    email STRING,
    sample_date DATE,
    notes STRING,
    lowlights STRING,
    learnings STRING,
    trip_region STRING,
    number_of_days INT,
    estimated_cost FLOAT,
    product_mix STRING
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
"separatorChar" = ",",
"quoteChar" = "\"",
"escapeChar" = "\\" 
)
TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1")
LOCATION 's3a://<bucket-name>/<csv-file-rootdir>'
```
**NOTE:** The `LOCATION` statement needs a path to the directory where the file is stored, not the file path.

1. You will see the result of table creation.
![New table created](../../assets/img/pages/docs/data-catalog/table-creation.png "New table created")

1. We can now query the data.
```
select * from opendatahub.sample limit 10;
```
1. Check the query results in Hue.
