What is new?
------

Open Data Hub 0.6.1 is now available in OpenShift OperatorHub. It comes with many important bug fixes in the operator, some new components and integration with OpenShift CI.

We have also added READMEs for all the components to make sure it is easy for users to orient themselves in the new manifests structure.

The components added or (re)enabled in this version are:

| Technology | Version | Category | Deployment Method | 
|--|--|--|--|
| [Seldon](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-manifests/tree/master/odhseldon) | 1.1.0 | Model Serving | OLM |


We have also enabled OpenShift CI for our odh-manifests repository to help us with PR reviews. We have a basic set of tests and are [expanding the test set](https://github.com/orgs/opendatahub-io/projects/4) to make sure that your PRs are reviewed faster in a more automated fashion.
