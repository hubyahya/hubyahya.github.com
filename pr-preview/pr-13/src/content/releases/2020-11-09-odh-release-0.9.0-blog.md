What is new?
------
The Open Data Hub 0.9.0 release provides updates for successfully deploying v1.2 of upstream Kubeflow on OpenShift 4.3 (or later) and a new Open Data Hub [Dashboard](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard) that lists ODH components that are currently installed and provides links to application dashboards and documentation.

You can find out more about the components available in the upstream deployment of Kubeflow v1.2 [here](https://blog.kubeflow.org/release/official/2020/11/18/kubeflow-1.2-blog-post.html)

Additionally, Prometheus will now scrape metrics for Kafka and Jupyterhub components and we added the ability to deploy a single [ceph-container] to provide all-n-one object storage for minimal deployments.
