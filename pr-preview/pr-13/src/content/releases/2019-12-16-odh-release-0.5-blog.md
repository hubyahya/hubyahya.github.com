What is included?
------
Open Data Hub 0.5.0 includes many new tools that are essential to a comprehensive AI/ML end-to-end platform. Open Data Hub is a meta-operator that can be installed on Openshift Container Platform 3.11 and 4.x.

The following is a list of tools added to Open Data Hub in this release:

| Technology | Version | Category |
|--|--|--|
| JupyterHub CUDA GPU Images and Notebooks | 3.0.7  | Support for building CUDA GPU Images and GPU Notebook |
| Apache [Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset) | 0.34.0  | Data Exploration and Visualization Tool |
| Data Catalog ([Hue](https://gethue.com/), [Spark Thrift Server](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-distributed-sql-engine.html), Hive Metastore) | Hue 4.4.1 & Spark Thrift Server 2.4 & Hive Metastore 1.2.1 | Deployment of Hue, Spark Thrift Server and Hive Metastore to simplify querying data lakes using Spark SQL language|
| [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo/) | 2.4.2 | Container native workflow engine |


You can review the release notes for components added in the previous v0.4.0 release [here](https://opendatahub.io/news/2019-09-16/odh-release-0.4-blog.html)

AICoE-JupyterHub CUDA GPU Images and Notebooks
------
AICoE-JupyterHub now has support for accessing NVIDIA GPUs from Jupyter notebooks. In this release, we added 
* Documentation on how to [enable GPUs nodes](https://gitlab.com/opendatahub/opendatahub-operator/blob/v0.5.0/docs/enabling-gpu-aicoe-jupyterhub.adoc) in your OpenShift cluster
* Support for building CUDA GPU images and notebooks as part of the component deployment process

You can test these new features by following the Data Engineering and Machine Learning [workshop](https://gitlab.com/opendatahub/data-engineering-and-machine-learning-workshop). The [tf-training-serving](https://gitlab.com/opendatahub/data-engineering-and-machine-learning-workshop/blob/master/source/notebooks/tf-training-serving.ipynb) contains a demonstration of how you can create Openshift Jobs to access a cluster GPU.

Apache Superset
------
Apache [Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset) is a data exploration and visualization tool. Instructions for deploying and creating an example database & chart are available in [Deploy Superset Setup](https://gitlab.com/opendatahub/opendatahub-operator/blob/v0.5.0/docs/deploying-superset.adoc).

Data Catalog (Tech Preview)
------
The Data Catalog is a set of components with which you can run Data Exploration on your Data Lake. These components are:
* *Hive Metastore* to store metadada information about the Hive tables
* *Spark SQL Thrift server* to expose a ODBC/JDBC endpoint to interact with the Hive Tables
* *Hue* to view S3 object store, connect to Spark SQL Thrift server and run queries, as well as create dashboards.

For more information on the Data Catalog, please review the Data Catalog [announcement](https://opendatahub.io/news/2019-12-15/data-catalog-in-odh.html) and [tutorial](https://opendatahub.io/docs/advanced-tutorials/data-exploration.html). The Data Catalog is currently designated as "Tech Preview" as we enable support for additional features available in Hue.

Argo
------
[Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/) has been updated to version 2.4.2. [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/) is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.  It is useful for defining workflows using containers, running computer intensive jobs, and orchestrating DAG container pipelines natively on Kubernetes.
