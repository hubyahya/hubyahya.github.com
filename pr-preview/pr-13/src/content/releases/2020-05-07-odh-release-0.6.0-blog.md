What is new?
------
Open Data Hub 0.6.0 adopted Kubeflow as upstream which lead to conversion from Ansible Operator to Kustomize for component deployment and management.

All key project repositories moved to Github [opendatahub-io organization](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/):

* https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-operator/
* https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-manifests/

Most of the components were converted to Kustomize and moved to the above mentioned repositories.

Another important change is that ODH 0.6 and forward relies on Operator Lifecycle Manager to install and manage some of the components to avoid duplication of operator deployment manifests which are already available through OLM.

The following is a list of tools are available in ODH 0.6.0:
