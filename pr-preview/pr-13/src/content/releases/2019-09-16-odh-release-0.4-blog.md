| Open Data Hub Operator | 0.4.0 | Meta Operator Application management |
| [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo/) | 2.3.0 | Container native workflow engine |
| [Strimzi Kafka Operator](https://strimzi.io/) | 0.11.1 | Distributed streaming platform |
| Open Data Hub [AI-Library](https://opendatahub.io) | 1.0  | Machine learning as a service |


You can review the release notes for components added in the v0.3.0 release [here](https://opendatahub.io/news/2019-06-27/odh-release-0.3-blog.html)

Argo
------
[Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/) is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.  It is useful for defining workflows using containers, running computer intensive jobs, and running CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes.

Strimzi Kafka Operator
------
[Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) provides a way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes in various deployment configurations. [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed streaming platform for publishing and subscribing records as well as storing and processing streams of records.

Strimzi is based on Apache Kafka 2.0.1 and consists of three main components:

* Cluster Operator
  Responsible for deploying and managing Apache Kafka clusters within OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.

* Topic Operator
  Responsible for managing Kafka topics within a Kafka cluster running within OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.

* User Operator
  Responsible for managing Kafka users within a Kafka cluster running within OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.

Open Data Hub AI-Library
------
AI-Library is an open source collection of AI components that allows for rapid prototyping of ideas. AI-Library enables users to work with machine learning models without worrying about infrastructure issues, model complexity or any data science expertise.
