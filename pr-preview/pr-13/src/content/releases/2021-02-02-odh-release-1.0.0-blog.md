What is new?
------
Open Data Hub 1.0.0 brings in many new features and components. Components from Data Catalog such as Hue and Spark ThirftServer are now migrated and included in ODH beta. We added two new Kubeflow components: KF Serving and KF Pipeline on Tekton. JupyterHub now has a new Spawner User Interface that includes more customization options. ODH Argo has also been upgraded to the latest release, v2.12.5. 
Legacy option for installing ODH has been removed as the team focuses on ODH Beta where all the new features and bug fixes will be included moving forward. 
An important note to users, ODH 1.0 includes three example KFDefs for installation on OpenShift 4.3 (or later) :
1. ODH components [KFDef](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatahub-io/odh-manifests/master/kfdef/kfctl_openshift.yaml)
2. Kubeflow 1.2 [KFDef](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/master/kfdef/kfctl_openshift.v1.2.0.yaml)
3. Kubeflow from master that included KF Serving and KF Pipeline on Tekton [KFDef](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/master/kfdef/kfctl_openshift.master.kfptekton.yaml)
